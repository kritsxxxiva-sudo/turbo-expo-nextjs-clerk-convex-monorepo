- **Frontend Mobile**: Expo with React Native (New Architecture)
- **Backend**: Convex (serverless, real-time database)
- **Authentication**: Clerk with multi-provider OAuth
- **Payments**: Stripe with comprehensive billing features
- **Social Media**: Ayrshare.com unified API
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with Yarn workspaces

### Database Schema Overview

```typescript
// Core tables for comprehensive integration
users: defineTable({
  clerkId: v.string(),
  email: v.string(),
  role: v.union(v.literal("admin"), v.literal("premium"), v.literal("free")),
  preferences: v.object({...}),
  subscription: v.optional(v.object({...})),
  // ... additional fields
})

socialAccounts: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  platform: v.union(/* 13+ platforms */),
  accessToken: v.string(), // Encrypted
  // ... additional fields
})

customers: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  stripeCustomerId: v.string(),
  // ... Stripe customer data
})

subscriptions: defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),
  stripeSubscriptionId: v.string(),
  status: v.union(/* subscription statuses */),
  // ... subscription details
})
```

### API Integration Architecture

```typescript
// Centralized API client utilities
class BaseApiClient {
  // Unified HTTP client with retry logic, caching, error handling
}

class StripeClient extends BaseApiClient {
  // Stripe-specific operations
}

class AyrshareClient extends BaseApiClient {
  // Ayrshare-specific operations
}

class ApiClientFactory {
  // Factory for creating configured clients
}
```

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Architecture and Integration Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-06

**Q1: Integration Approach**
Should we implement all integrations simultaneously or in phases?
**A1**: Implement in phases with proper dependency management:

1. Phase 1: TypeScript configuration and API client utilities (foundation)
2. Phase 2: Database schema enhancement and Clerk authentication
3. Phase 3: Stripe payment processing integration
4. Phase 4: Ayrshare social media integration

**Q2: Database Strategy**
How should we handle data synchronization between external services and our database?
**A2**: Use webhook-driven synchronization with Convex actions:

- Clerk webhooks for user management
- Stripe webhooks for payment events
- Ayrshare callbacks for social media events
- Implement idempotent webhook processing with retry logic

**Q3: TypeScript Strictness Level**
What level of TypeScript strictness should we enforce?
**A3**: Maximum strictness with the following configuration:

- Enable all strict compiler options
- No `any` types except for specific external API responses
- Explicit return types for all public functions
- Strict null checks and optional property handling

**Q4: Error Handling Strategy**
How should we handle errors across different external services?
**A4**: Implement tiered error handling:

- Network errors: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Authentication errors: Clear re-authentication prompts
- Rate limiting: Queue management and user notifications
- Service outages: Graceful degradation with user feedback

**Q5: Testing Strategy**
What testing approach should we use for external service integrations?
**A5**: Comprehensive testing strategy:

- Unit tests with mocked external services
- Integration tests with test/sandbox environments
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for high-load scenarios
